Builder Pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach 
This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the 
best ways to create an object 

A builder class builds the final object step by step . This builder is independent of other objects


            IMPLEMENTATION
We have considered a bussiness of fast-food resturant where a typical meal could be a burger 
and a cold drink . Burger could be either Veg Burger  or a Chicken Burger and will be packed 
by a wrapper . Cold drink could be either a coke or pepsi and will be packed in a bottle

We are going to create an Item interface representing food items such as burgers and cold drinks
abd concrete classes implementing the Item interface and a packing Interface representing packaging 
of food items and and concrete classes implementing the packing interface as burger would be packedby wrapper
and cold drink would be packed as bottle.

We then create a Meal class having ArrayList of Item and a MealBuilder to build different 
types of meal objects by combining items. BuilderPatternDemo, our demo class will use meal 
builder to build a meal
