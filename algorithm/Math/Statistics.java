     *      Class Intervals and Class Limit
     * A symbol defining a class such as 60- 62, is called a class interval, The end 
     * number 60 and 62 are called class limits
     * 
     *  Class Boundaries
     * the class boundaries are obtained by adding the upper limit of oneclass 
     * interval to the lower limit of of the next class interval and by dividing by 2
     * 
     *     Class Width
     * THe size of the class interval is the difference between the lower 
     * and upper class boundaries and is also referred to as class size, or class length
     * if all class intervals of a frequency distribution have equal widths, ths common
     * width is denoted by c
     * 
     *      Class Mark
     * The class mark is the midpoint of the class interval and is obtained 
     * by adding the upper and the lower class limits and dividing by 2
